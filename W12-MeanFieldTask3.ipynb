For instance, make sure you're only using `H_5`, `H_7`, `H_9`, and `X_8`  when computing an update for `H_8`. That is, only left-, right-, and down-shifted pixels should be contributing to `H_8`'s neighourhood sums. If you mistakenly add an up-shifted pixel to `H_8`'s neighourhood sums (whether it's a copy of `H_8` or a no-ink/zero pixel), you are effectively imposing an extra neighborhood edge between `H_8` and a \"ghost\" pixel below it; notice that our boltzman machine doesn't have a neighborhood edge between `H_8` and anything below it, therefore, neither `H_8` nor an extra non-inky pixel should be participating in `H_8`'s neighborhood sums and update.\n",
